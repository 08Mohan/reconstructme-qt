    * Press Configure (use native compiler MS Visual Studio 2010 x86)
    * ReconstructMeSDK and Qt will be found by CMake if the Libraries are installed. (It could be that you have to set the path to _Qt bin folder_ manually in the PATH environment variable)
    * Don't matter about google protocol buffers in CMake, since this is shipped in the 3rd_party folder, and the dependencies are set in CMakeLists.txt. You can see this in the output of the CMake GUI.
    * Press generate.
  * Now, you have a solution called ReconstructMeQt.sln.
  * Open the solution.
