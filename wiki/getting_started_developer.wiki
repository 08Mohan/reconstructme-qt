  * Run CMake GUI and select _source_ folder to GUI and a _build_ folder
    * Press Configure (use native compiler MS Visual Studio 2010 x86)
    * ReconstructMeSDK and Qt should be found. (Maybe the path to qt bin folder has to be added manually to the PATH environment variable)
    * Don't matter about google protocol buffers in CMake, since this is shipped in the 3rd_party folder, and the dependencies are set in CMakeLists.txt. You can see this in the output of the CMake GUI.
    * Press generate.
  * Now, you have a solution called ReconstructMeQt.sln.
  * Open the solution.
  * Build the Project ReconstructMeGUI in *Release* mode (*Debug* mode is not supported at the moment).
